# Udacity-final-project---Pixel-Art-Maker
My final project from the Udacity Scholarship course on Front-end Developer.
This Project was carried out using Html, Css, and Javascript.
with this project users should be able to 
1. dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid
2. choose a color
3. click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
